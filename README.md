Aim Mastery
 In FPS games, aiming is the important skill to get a high score. 
 This project is for making a practicing site to develop your aiming skill for FPS games.
 First, you can click targets on your screen and get scores by how good you are at clicking targets.
 Second, it will store your scores.
 Third, many other people can play it simultaneously and their scores will also be stored.
 Fourth, you can compare your score with others.
 Fifth, check how good your aiming skill is and improve it.

I am going to use HTML5 canvas like Agar.io. (change to three.js Nov 11th 2017)
This project will need simple circle drawings and colors to distinguish high score targets.
And SQL database will also be used to store player information and scores.
The best score of each player will be printed on the screen when a player first enters the site.
